# Forecasting-pre

Data : contains the algorithm used to prepare data before using them in the models

One_sensor : contains the models at t+1 and t+n options 1 and 2 using LSTM and focusing on one sensor

All_sensors : contains the models at t+1 and t+n options 1 and 2 using LSTM and considering all the sensors at the same time

Graph : contains the models at t+1 of the models using graphs with GCN and LSTM but also GRUCell. Also contains the model at t+n using GCN and GRUCell.
